# CryptoVibe

CryptoVibe is a 3D Music Production Software, meant to be used in a VR environment. A music track can be made, sold into an NFT, and placed into a catalog alongside other NFTs! CryptoVibe combines the thrill of music with sleek graphics to create a modern, fun experience!

## Producing Music

CryptoVibe gives you the choice of adding piano, guitar, and even percussion to your tracks! All tracks will begin empty, and you can start populating the track with notes when you are ready to compose!

### Music Catalog

Choose the notes you want on the Music Catalog! There is an array of different notes of varying octaves to choose from, which you can adjust with the up and down arrows! Just click on the note you want to add, and it will be added straight into the music track!

### Populated Music Track Example

Once you finished using the music catalog, your music track will be populated! The track visually appears an array-style of sheet music, and is playable too! If you want your track to be longer, click the left and right arrows to traverse your track! Before we get on to playing, let's turn this track into an NFT!

### NFT Processing Screen

Attribute your track to ANY NFT image, and begin buying and selling NFTs! All NFTs are purely simuation, but once you start buying, you can add them to your transactions catalog!

### Transactions Catalog

You can add NFTs that you create or buy here, in the transactions catalog! When you are ready, you can select the NFT you want and play the music track attributed to your NFT!

### Music Playing Screen

Now, you can listen to all the songs of your NFTs! Feel free to go back or forward 5 seconds, loop, or restart the song at your own leisure!
